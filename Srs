Creating a meeting room booking system using ASP.NET Core, Angular, and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) with a combination of MVC for administration and Angular for the employee interface is a complex but achievable task. Below is a high-level guide to help you get started with the project:

### 1. **Project Setup**
   - **Tools & Technologies:**
     - **Backend:** ASP.NET Core
     - **Frontend:** Angular
     - **Database:** SQL Server (SSMS)
     - **Development Environment:** Visual Studio 2022 (or higher), Visual Studio Code
     - **Others:** Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap (optional for styling)

### 2. **Database Design**
   - **Tables:**
     1. **Rooms**: 
        - `RoomId` (Primary Key)
        - `RoomName`
        - `Location`
        - `Capacity`
        - `AvailabilityStatus`
     2. **Employees**: 
        - `EmployeeId` (Primary Key)
        - `Name`
        - `Email`
        - `Role` (Admin/Employee)
     3. **Bookings**: 
        - `BookingId` (Primary Key)
        - `RoomId` (Foreign Key)
        - `EmployeeId` (Foreign Key)
        - `BookingDate`
        - `StartTime`
        - `EndTime`
        - `Purpose`

   - **Relationships:**
     - One-to-Many: Rooms to Bookings
     - One-to-Many: Employees to Bookings

### 3. **ASP.NET Core Setup**
   - **Create ASP.NET Core Web API:**
     - Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project in Visual Studio.
     - Set up your `DbContext` using Entity Framework Core for database operations.
     - Define models that mirror your database tables (e.g., `Room`, `Employee`, `Booking`).
     - Create controllers (`RoomsController`, `EmployeesController`, `BookingsController`) to manage CRUD operations.

   - **Configure Identity:**
     - Set up ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication and role management.
     - Admins will have access to all functionalities, whereas employees will have restricted access (like booking a room).

### 4. **Angular Frontend (Employee Interface)**
   - **Create Angular Project:**
     - Set up a new Angular project using Angular CLI.
     - Create services to consume the ASP.NET Core Web API.
     - Create components for viewing available rooms, booking a room, and managing bookings.
     - Implement routing to navigate between different views (e.g., home, booking, and my bookings).
     - Use forms and validations for booking a room.

### 5. **MVC Model (Admin Interface)**
   - **Create Admin Interface using MVC:**
     - Within your ASP.NET Core project, add MVC controllers and views for administrative tasks.
     - Create views for managing rooms, viewing all bookings, and managing users.
     - Implement authorization filters to restrict access to admin views.
     - Use Razor Pages or MVC Views to render the admin pages.

### 6. **Connecting Angular to ASP.NET Core**
   - **CORS Setup:**
     - Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your ASP.NET Core project to allow the Angular app to communicate with the API.
   - **API Consumption:**
     - Use Angular HTTP Client to consume the endpoints provided by the ASP.NET Core Web API.

### 7. **Deployment**
   - **Prepare for Deployment:**
     - Publish the ASP.NET Core API to an IIS Server or a cloud service like Azure.
     - Build and deploy the Angular app to a static web server or include it within the ASP.NET Core application.
   - **Database Deployment:**
     - Deploy your SQL Server database, ensuring that all tables and relationships are correctly set up.

### 8. **Testing & Validation**
   - **Unit Testing:**
     - Implement unit tests for both the backend (using xUnit or NUnit) and the frontend (using Jasmine/Karma).
   - **Integration Testing:**
     - Test the entire system to ensure smooth interaction between the Angular frontend and ASP.NET Core backend.

### 9. **Documentation**
   - **API Documentation:**
     - Use Swagger/OpenAPI for generating API documentation.
   - **Code Documentation:**
     - Ensure that your code is well-commented, and create README files to help future developers understand your project.

### 10. **Security Considerations**
   - **Authentication & Authorization:**
     - Ensure that only authenticated users can access the system.
     - Use role-based authorization to manage access to admin functionalities.
   - **Data Validation:**
     - Implement server-side and client-side validation to prevent invalid data entries.
   - **Error Handling:**
     - Implement global exception handling in ASP.NET Core and Angular to gracefully handle errors.

### 11. **Future Enhancements**
   - **Notifications:**
     - Add email notifications for bookings and reminders.
   - **Room Availability:**
     - Implement a feature to display real-time room availability.
   - **Analytics:**
     - Add reporting capabilities for admins to view room usage statistics.
