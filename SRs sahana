Here's a basic Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document template for a Meeting Room Booking project using Angular as the frontend framework. This document outlines the project's functional and non-functional requirements, user roles, and system architecture.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed specification of the Meeting Room Booking System, which will enable users (Admins and Employees) to book meeting rooms within an organization. The system will be implemented using Angular for the frontend.

1.2 Scope
The Meeting Room Booking System allows users to book, manage, and view meeting rooms' availability. The system will support two user roles: Admin and Employee.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
Admin: User with privileges to manage meeting rooms, bookings, and user access.
Employee: User with the ability to book meeting rooms.
UI: User Interface

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The Meeting Room Booking System will be a web-based application designed to facilitate the booking of meeting rooms within an organization. It will have a responsive UI and will be integrated with a backend system through RESTful APIs.

2.2 Product Features
User Authentication & Authorization: Login and role-based access control for Admins and Employees.
Room Management: Admins can add, update, and delete meeting rooms.
Booking Management: Employees can view available rooms, book a room, view their bookings, and cancel bookings.
Admin Dashboard: A dashboard for Admins to view all bookings, manage rooms, and view system analytics.
Notifications: Email or in-app notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and reminders.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Admin:
Can add, update, and delete meeting rooms.
Can view and manage all bookings.
Can manage user roles and access.
Has access to system analytics and reports.
Employee:
Can view available rooms.
Can book a room for a specific time slot.
Can view and cancel their bookings.
Receives notifications for their bookings.
2.4 Operating Environment
Frontend: Angular (latest version) running on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Backend: RESTful API (technology to be decided, e.g., Node.js, .NET Core).
Database: SQL/NoSQL database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
Hosting: Cloud-based hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure).
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
The frontend must be responsive to support various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
The system must support concurrent bookings and prevent double bookings for the same time slot.
2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
Users have access to the internet.
The backend API will be developed in parallel and will provide necessary endpoints for the frontend to consume.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Authentication
FR1.1: The system shall allow users to log in using their corporate credentials.
FR1.2: The system shall differentiate between Admin and Employee roles upon login.
3.2 Room Management (Admin)
FR2.1: The system shall allow Admins to add new meeting rooms, specifying details such as room name, capacity, and available equipment.
FR2.2: The system shall allow Admins to update room details.
FR2.3: The system shall allow Admins to delete rooms, with a warning if there are future bookings.
3.3 Booking Management (Employee)
FR3.1: The system shall allow Employees to view available rooms based on date and time.
FR3.2: The system shall allow Employees to book a room for a specified time slot.
FR3.3: The system shall send a confirmation notification to the Employee upon successful booking.
FR3.4: The system shall allow Employees to view their upcoming and past bookings.
FR3.5: The system shall allow Employees to cancel their bookings.
3.4 Notifications
FR4.1: The system shall send email notifications to Employees upon booking confirmation.
FR4.2: The system shall send reminders to Employees for upcoming meetings.
FR4.3: The system shall notify Admins of any room conflicts or booking issues.
4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance Requirements
The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with no noticeable performance degradation.
Response time for booking operations should be less than 2 seconds.
4.2 Security Requirements
The system shall ensure that all data exchanges between frontend and backend are encrypted using HTTPS.
User data should be protected using role-based access controls.
4.3 Usability Requirements
The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate, adhering to best practices in UX design.
The system should be accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
4.4 Availability Requirements
The system should have 99.9% uptime, excluding scheduled maintenance.
5. System Architecture
5.1 Frontend
The frontend will be developed using Angular.
Responsive design using Bootstrap or Material Design.
State management using NgRx (if required for complexity).
5.2 Backend
RESTful API to be implemented using Node.js/Express or ASP.NET Core.
Authentication managed using JWT.
Database layer managed using ORM (e.g., Sequelize, Entity Framework).
5.3 Database
Relational database (e.g., MySQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for storing user data, room details, and booking records.
5.4 Deployment
The frontend and backend will be deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to be set up for automated deployments.
6. Acceptance Criteria
Admins can successfully add, update, and delete meeting rooms.
Employees can book and cancel meeting rooms.
The system sends appropriate notifications to users.
The UI is responsive and meets usability standards.
